Note:
    If you want quality scalability, you should generate multiple layers with
    `-rate' or by using the "Clayers" option.

Generated 1 tile-part(s) for a total of 1 tile(s).
Code-stream bytes (excluding any file format) = 45,920 = 0.597917 bits/pel.
Compressed bytes (excludes codestream headers) = 45,697 = 0.595013 bpp.
Body bytes (excludes packet and codestream headers) = 45,313 = 0.590013 bpp.
Layer bit-rates (possibly inexact if tiles are divided across tile-parts):
