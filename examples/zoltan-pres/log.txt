Note:
    The default rate control policy for colour images employs visual (CSF)
    weighting factors.  To minimize MSE instead, specify `-no_weights'.
Note:
    If you want quality scalability, you should generate multiple layers with
    `-rate' or by using the "Clayers" option.

Generated 1 tile-part(s) for a total of 1 tile(s).
Code-stream bytes (excluding any file format) = 33,034 = 0.396210 bits/pel.
Compressed bytes (excludes codestream headers) = 32,805 = 0.393463 bpp.
Body bytes (excludes packet and codestream headers) = 32,472 = 0.389469 bpp.
Layer bit-rates (possibly inexact if tiles are divided across tile-parts):
