Note:
    The default rate control policy for colour images employs visual (CSF)
    weighting factors.  To minimize MSE instead, specify `-no_weights'.
Note:
    If you want quality scalability, you should generate multiple layers with
    `-rate' or by using the "Clayers" option.

Generated 1 tile-part(s) for a total of 1 tile(s).
Code-stream bytes (excluding any file format) = 129,105 = 0.985271 bits/pel.
