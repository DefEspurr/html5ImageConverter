Note:
    The default rate control policy for colour images employs visual (CSF)
    weighting factors.  To minimize MSE instead, specify `-no_weights'.
Note:
    If you want quality scalability, you should generate multiple layers with
    `-rate' or by using the "Clayers" option.

Generated 1 tile-part(s) for a total of 1 tile(s).
Code-stream bytes (excluding any file format) = 146,096 = 0.490894 bits/pel.
Compressed bytes (excludes codestream headers) = 145,864 = 0.490115 bpp.
Body bytes (excludes packet and codestream headers) = 144,436 = 0.485316 bpp.
